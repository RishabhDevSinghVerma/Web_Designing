A block-level element is an element in HTML and CSS that generates a block-level box. It starts on a new line and takes up the full width available by default. Block-level elements are typically used for larger sections of content, such as paragraphs, headings, divs, lists, and structural components of a webpage.

1-Occupies Full Width: By default, block-level elements occupy the full width of their parent container. They start on a new line and push subsequent elements to a new line as well.

2-Line Breaks: Block-level elements introduce line breaks before and after themselves, creating vertical spacing and separating content visually.

3-Height and Width: Block-level elements can have both a specified height and width. They can be set to specific dimensions using CSS properties like height and width.

4-Box Model: Block-level elements follow the box model, which means they have padding, borders, and margins. These properties can be set and modified using CSS.

<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>: These are structural elements commonly used in HTML5 to define different sections of a webpage, such as the header, navigation, main content, and footer. These elements are block-level and provide semantic meaning to the structure of the page.

<pre>: The <pre> element is used to define preformatted text. It preserves whitespace and line breaks, allowing for the display of code or text with fixed spacing.
