A computer network is a group of computers linked to each other that enables the computer to communicate with another computer and share their resources, data, and applications.

|-A computer network is mainly of four types:
|
|-LAN(Local Area Network)=>Local Area Network is a group of computers connected to each other in a small area such as 
|                          building, office.
|
|-PAN(Personal Area Network)=>Thomas Zimmerman was the first research scientist to bring the idea of the Personal Area 
|                              Network.Personal Area Network covers an area of 30 feet.Personal Area Network is a network 
|                              arranged within an individual person, typically within a range of 10 meters.
|                              Personal Area Network is used for connecting the computer devices of personal use is known 
|                              as Personal Area Network.Personal computer devices that are used to develop the personal 
|                              area network are the laptop, mobile phones, media player and play stations.
|
|-MAN(Metropolitan Area Network)=>A metropolitan area network is a network that covers a larger geographic area by 
|                              interconnecting a different LAN to form a larger network.Government agencies use MAN to 
|                              connect to the citizens and private industries.
|
|-WAN(Wide Area Network)=>A Wide Area Network is a network that extends over a large geographical area such as states or 
|                              countries.A Wide Area Network is quite bigger network than the LAN.
|                              A Wide Area Network is not limited to a single location, but it spans over a large 
|                              geographical area through a telephone line, fibre optic cable or satellite links.
|                              The internet is one of the biggest WAN in the world.A Wide Area Network is widely used in 
|                              the field of Business, government, and education.
