CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web design and layout. It describes how elements in HTML are rendered and how their dimensions are calculated.

The box model consists of four components that define the size and spacing of an element:

1-Content: This is the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other media. It is represented by the width and height properties.

2-Padding: The padding is the space between the content and the border of the element. It is transparent by default and can be set using the padding property.

3-Border: The border surrounds the padding and content of an element. It can be styled using properties like border-width, border-color, and border-style.

4-Margin: The margin is the space outside the border, which separates the element from other elements. It is transparent and can be set using the margin property.
