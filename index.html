In the late 1980's , a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN, proposed a system for CERN researchers. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system.
Tim Berners-Lee is known as the father of HTML. The first available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags" proposed by Tim in late 1991.
